# TODO App

Just what the world needs! Another "hello world" style Todo App! You're welcome world. :)

This is built with React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I originally built this in early 2021 using class based components and then immediately refactored it to functional components using a reducer for my state. I refactored in early 2023 to clean it up for fun. I removed the overkill reducer and just used a couple of state variables. I also removed a bunch of unnecessary components to clean up the file structure.
